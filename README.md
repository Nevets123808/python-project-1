# Slow Trader

## Project Brief

To create a CRUD application with utilisation of supporting tools,
methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules
covered during training.

## Overview

This project represents the (very) basic structure for a slow paced trading game.
Users own Ships which they use to trade Items with Cities.
Cities are connect by Routes, which Ships move along to travel between Cities. (the state of being in a City will be
represented by a Route that starts and ends in the same city.)

Our MVP is an app that will allow Users to check(read)/update the Ships they own, and command them to move between Cities.
All Users will also be able to "buy"(create) new Ships.
Special Admin Users will be allowed to create and update Cities and Routes.

### Planned Structure

Below is diagram showing the proposed ERD for this project, as well as the "actions" a User will be able to make with their ship. These do not include "book keeping" actions such as renaming ships, or changing user details.

The diagram is split into two sections, the main section is what I want to complete for this project. The section marked "Additional" represents proposed additions to the project for added functionality.

### Risk assessment

The project has been risk assessed and appropriate mitigations have been implemented as shown in the matrix below:

## Stage 1: Users own ships

The first step of the project was to create two tables, Users and Ships, as well as routes and forms as necessary to allow users of the app to create a User, update the details of a User and delete Users, as well as create Ships, rename Ships and delete Ships.
