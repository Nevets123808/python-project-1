Outline
-------

This project represents the (very) basic structure for a slow paced trading game.
Users own Ships which they use to trade Items with Cities.
Cities are connect by Routes, which Ships move along to travel between Cities. (the state of being in a City will be
represented by a Route that starts and ends in the same city.)

Our MVP is an app that will allow Users to check(read)/update the Ships they own, and command them to move between Cities.
All Users will also be able to "buy"(create) new Ships.
Special Admin Users will be allowed to create and update Cities and Routes.

Extension possiblities:
- Items - implement a system that allows Ships to contain Items and transfer them between Cities
- Trading - allow Items and Ships to be bought and sold for (in-game) money, Cities have different prices
- Login Credentials - In the MVP implementation there is no "log in" form, could provide password protection

Future extension possibilities
- price fluctuation - When the user buys/sells an Item the price in that City should change mimicing supply/demand economics
- AI traders
- Item demand at Cities - Cities need Items to function, Cities have their own stocks of items, which change based on City

---MVP---
Models:

We need a flask model for every table required for the mvp:
- Users
- Ships
- Cities
- Routes

Routes:

We need to create routes for all of the operations possible in the MVP implementation of the project

We need user accessible routes for:
-Select User/Sign in d
-Create new User/Sign up d
-Delete User/Delete Account d
-Update User details d
-Check Ships d
-Create new Ship/Buy Ship d
-Update Ship Details d
-Change Ship's Route/Sail Ship to City d

we need admin only routes for:
-Make User Admin d

We need Flask Forms For:
